## MVP

Recreate a simplified version of the game Minesweeper to be played in the java console
The game should be able to randomly generate 10 mines in a 10x10 grid
The user will be able to enter a command that represents a coordinate to check a location for a mine
The application will display a number from 0-8 depending on how many mines surround that location
If the user selects a mine, the game will respond "boom!" and the game will be lost
If every non-mine square has been revealed, the game is won
Render the grid to the console after every user command

## Bonuses (optional)

Allow for the user to configure number of mines and grid size via a configuration.
(Difficult) Discovering an empty square should reveal all squares around it, and cascade into other nearby empty squares
